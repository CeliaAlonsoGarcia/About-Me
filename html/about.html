      <h2 class="accordion">Why do I want to become a web developer?</h2>

      <div class="panel">
        <ul class="reasons">
         
            <h3>Continuous learning</h3>
            <p>
              One of the main reasons why I would like to change my career and
              become a software developer is that I have reached a learning
              ceiling in my current job and find it difficult to progress and
              develop further. Something I love about software development is
              that you never stop learning and there is always room to grow and
              improve.
            </p>
         

         
            <h3>Creative work</h3>
            <p>
              Before I started coding, I never thought of software development
              as a tool I could use to express my creativity. Learning to code
              completely changed my view on that. I love how coding allows you
              to use your creativity to build and create your own designs as
              well as to find solutions to problems.
            </p>
         

         
            <h3>Problem solving</h3>
            <p>
              I have always loved solving puzzles and finding solutions to
              problems. There is nothing like the feeling of using your brain to
              find an answer. I love the satisfaction you get when debugging and
              making something work. I am aware that sometimes you may not be
              able to find a solution to a problem for days, but nothing beats
              the feeling of finally solving it.
            </p>
         

        
            <h3>Power of tech</h3>
            <p>
              Since I left university, I have always wanted to work for a
              company that is a force for good. That's why, in my current and
              previous jobs, I worked for small companies with strong
              sustainable values. In recent years, many of the new companies I
              admire have one thing in common: they use tech as a tool to change
              the world. Some good examples are Olio, Beam, TooGoodToGo, or The
              Good Gym. I feel extremely excited to have the necessary skills to
              write the code for some tech that will change the world for the
              better.
            </p>
        

        
            <h3>I really enjoy coding</h3>
            <p>
              Since day one, I have found coding fascinating. I could spend
              hours coding and not notice the time pass. Like with everything,
              there have been harder times when I would get stuck on a problem
              and struggle to find a solution, but managing to solve the
              challenges made it so worth it.

      <h2 class="accordion">What have been my progress like?</h2>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          In Januray, when I decided to give the application a go I didn't know
          anything about coding. I started reading the resources and followed
          every step in
          <a

            A complete guide to making web pages from scratch</a

          <a
            class="website"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web"
          >
            MDN: Getting started with the web</a
          >. Without noticing, I found myself learning to code for hours without
          realising time passing by.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the start there was a steep learning curve as every concept was
          new. I would read an explanation and would have to google several
          words in a sentence to try to understand the simplest tutorial:
        </p>

        <p class="question"><em>What does deploy mean?</em></p>
        <p class="question"><em>What is the terminal? </em></p>
        <p class="question"><em>How do I find it? </em></p>
        <p class="question"><em>What is repostory? </em></p>

        <p>
          Fastfoward three months and after studying an average of 5.5 days a
          week, I now know the difference between Github and Git, I can easily
          use buttons to make a photo appear or disappear, I can tell people
          where I've
          <em>deployed</em> my websit, how I <em>iterate</em> throgh a
          <em>loop</em> and more importantly - I'm not scared of JavaScript
          anymore.

      <h2 class="accordion">Why Founders and Coders?</h2>
      <ul class="panel">
        <h3>I love how FAC works to make the industry more accessible</h3>
        <p>
          It's difficult to explain, but even though I found out about Founders
          & Coders in November, I thought it was not for me. It felt like it was
          too out of my reach, and I didn't allow myself to even start reading
          about the first project. I am the first generation in my family to go
          to university as my parents only finished primary school. I don't have
          any references to people close to me who are in the industry, and
          being a woman made it all seem extra intimidating.
          <br />
          Then, in January, I received an email from Sarah inviting me to the
          Support Circle. It made me think that maybe it was for me as well. I
          decided to start looking at the resources, and once I started learning
          about how to create my Hobby Page, it turned out that I loved it and
          couldn't stop learning. <br />
          I feel extremely grateful to Founders and Coders for having shown me
          what a great collaborative environment this industry is. By going to
          the meet-ups, I was able to meet other people who were on the same
          path, and we were all helping and supporting each other.
        </p>
        <h3>FAC is not an intimidating space</h3>
        <p>
          Founders and Coders creates a great collaborative environment where
          everyone supports each other. This, together with FAC's promise to
          diversify the industry, makes me feel encouraged to learn coding and
          not intimidated by the learning environment.
        </p>
        <h3>I am an absolute believer in Peer Learning</h3>
        <p>
          In my academic life, I have always learned through teacher-centered
          experiences. Founders and Coders has given me the opportunity to
          experience a peer learning approach, and I loved it. It created a
          great team spirit where we could relate to the difficulties we were
          having and where we would all be encouraging each other. It was also
          surprising how much you gained from helping out others - it was a very
          rewarding experience that helped reinforce your learning.
        </p>
        <h3>Positive impact</h3>
        <p>
          One of the things that caught my attention when I found Founders and
          Coders was their program <em>Tech for Better</em>. Ethics and values
          are very important to me, and seeing that program reassured me that
          FAC's values aligned with mine, and it would be a good place for me to
          learn.
