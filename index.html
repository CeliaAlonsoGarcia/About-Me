        <ul class="reasons">
         
            <h3>Passionate About Helping Dissadvantaged Communities</h3>
            <p>
            Last year, I started volunteering at the North London Action for Homeless gardening project. 
            This project provides a safe space where people can experience a sense of belonging. 
            This first-hand experience with homelessness opened my eyes to this complex issue in the UK and motivated me to do something about it.
            Before that, after university, I spent six months volunteering at different charities in Asia that tackled homelessness and lack of education in deprived areas. 
            During that time, I also developed a fundraising campaign to buy and deliver water filters to various charities

            <h3>I Believe In Tech As A Force For Good</h3>
            <p>
          
            </p>

      <h2 class="accordion">Why would I be the perfect Client Success Manager?</h2>
      <div class="panel">
       
         <h3>Great at Identiflying & Creating New Partnerships </h3>
            <p>
           At my current job as a Marketing and Collaborations Manager at Fill Refill, a sustainability focus start-up, 
           I enjoy identifying partnerships opportunities and creating long-term relationships with other brands, organisations and charities. 
           I regularly organise stands at tradeshows and events where we build brand awareness and pitch to potential new clients. 
            </p>
              <h3>Excellent Communication & Customer Service Skills </h3>
            <p>
           I have great customer service skills that I have developed in my current job and in previous roles such as Export Coordinator at Fill Refill, 
           Customer Care Representative at BLANC, a different sustainable start-up, and Sales Assistant at a luxury department store. 
           In these roles, I needed a great sense of diplomacy as I constantly interacted with people from all walks of life - from big fashion brands to international accounts or individuals. 
           In my day to day in these roles, I maintained and created accounts, while negotiating customer rates, 
           doing phone and email coverage and carrying out complaints investigation and resolution.
            </p>
               <h3>Experience Creating & Delivering Presentions </h3>
            <p>
           In my current role, I regularly pitch to potential new accounts and award and grant panels. 
           In several of my previous roles, I carried out business development tasks and presented to potential new accounts. 
</p>
               <h3>
Exceptional organisational skills and problem-solving ability </h3>
            <p>
            A great part of my previous role as a Closed Loop Coordinator involved finding out what sustainable practices could be improved, 
            coming up with solutions and managing the projects to implement the changes. 
            This together with my experience organising stands at tradeshows and events 
            helped me develop my organisation skills and taught me how to react in a calm and fast way to unexpected events. 
 
</p>
               <h3>
And.. </h3>
        <p>



 

I am an active and positive person that likes to get involved, I have great initiative and the ability to easily build rapport. I am a very confident speaker that thrives in a busy environment where I can develop and learn. As I truly share your passion to use tech as a force for good  I know I would commit all my energy to this role. </p>
