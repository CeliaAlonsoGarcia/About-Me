        <h2 class="about">ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p class="text">
          My name is Celia Alonso, I am an extrovert people’s person who is
          eager to help disadvantaged communities. I am excited to apply for the
          Client Success Manager role at Beam as I'm extremely passionate about
          using technology for good. I’m a dedicated advocate for social justice
          and have a genuine desire to make a positive impact in the world.
        </p>

        <h2 class="accordion">Why do I want to work for Beam?</h2>

      <div class="panel">
        <ul class="reasons">
         
            <h3>Mission driven</h3>
            <p>
              One of the main reasons why I would like to change my career and
              become a software developer is that I have reached a learning
              ceiling in my current job and find it difficult to progress and
              develop further. Something I love about software development is
              that you never stop learning and there is always room to grow and
              improve.
            </p>
        

        
            <h3>Power of tech</h3>
            <p>
              Since I left university, I have always wanted to work for a
              company that is a force for good. That's why, in my current and
              previous jobs, I worked for small companies with strong
              sustainable values. In recent years, many of the new companies I
              admire have one thing in common: they use tech as a tool to change
              the world. Some good examples are Olio, Beam, TooGoodToGo, or The
              Good Gym. I feel extremely excited to have the necessary skills to
              write the code for some tech that will change the world for the
              better.
            </p>

      <h2 class="accordion">Why would I be the perfect Client Success Manager?</h2>
      <div class="panel">
       
         <h3>Great Communication Skills & Experience Creating & Identiflying New Partnerships </h3>
            <p>
            As a Marketing and Collaborations Manager at Fill Refill, a sustainability-focused start-up I am a driven individual and have great communication skills. At my current job as a Marketing and Collaborations Manager at Fill Refill, a sustainability focus start-up, I enjoy identifying partnerships opportunities and creating long-term relationships with other brands, organisations and charities. I regularly organise stands at tradeshows and events where we build increase brand awareness and pitch to potential new clients. 
            </p>
              <h3>Great Customer Service Skills </h3>
            <p>
           I have great customer service skills that I have developed in previous roles such as Export Coordinator at Fill Refill, Customer Care Representative at BLANC, a different sustainable start-up, and Sales Assistant at a luxury department store. In these roles, I needed a great sense of diplomacy as I constantly interacted with people from all walks of life - from big fashion brands to international accounts or individuals. In my day to day in these roles, I maintained and took care of existing accounts, while negotiating customer rates, doing phone and email coverage and carrying out complaints investigation and resolution.
            </p>
               <h3>Experience Creating & Delivering presentions </h3>
            <p>
           In my current role, I regularly pitch to potential new accounts and award and grant panels. In several of my previous roles, I carried out business development tasks and presented to potential new accounts. 
</p>
               <h3>
I have great organisational skills and problem-solving ability </h3>
            <p>
            A great part of my previous role as a Closed Loop Coordinator involved finding out what sustainable practices could be improved, coming up with solutions and managing the projects to implement the changes. This together with my experience organising stands at tradeshows and events helped me develop my organisation skills and taught me how to react in a calm and fast way to unexpected events. 
 
</p>
        <p>



 

I am an active and positive person that likes to get involved, I have great initiative and the ability to easily build rapport. I am a very confident speaker that thrives in a busy environment where I can develop and learn. As I truly share your passion to use tech as a force for good  I know I would commit all my energy to this role. </p>
